    "Supervised machine learning takes places in two steps: the training phase, and the testing phase. In the training phase, you use a portion of your data to train your algorithm (which, in our case, is a classification algorithm). You provide both your feature vector and your labels to the algorithm, and the algorithm searches for patterns in your data that can help associate it with a particular label.\n",

    "In the testing phase, we use the classifier we trained in the previous step, and give it previously unseen feature vectors representing unseen data to the algorithm, and have the algorithm predict the label. We can then compare the \"true\" label to the predicted label, and see if our classifier provides us with a good and generalizable way of accomplishing the task (in our case, the task of automatically distinguishing news sentences from romance sentences)."
